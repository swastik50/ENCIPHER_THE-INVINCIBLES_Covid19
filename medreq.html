        The demand for Remdesivir injection in the treatment of patients with Covid-19 and the
         discussion of its scarcity has now become a major issue in the country. Meanwhile, the
          central government has banned oxygen for non-industrial use as the shortage of oxygen 
          supplied to the patients also led to a war-like situation. Watch the video for more information
          Remdisivir injection has also gone up, and to meet that the government has made an interim allocation
           of the anti viral drug for 19 States/UTs for the period up to April 30, 2021. These 19 states are
            Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
             Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand.<br><br>

          “Remdesivir being an investigational therapy drug given in acute and severe versions of Covid-19 
          where oxygen support is a must, this allocation pertains to 14 States to which medical oxygen is
           allocated and 5 other states where the high volume of supplies are being observed,” the Union 
           Health Ministry said on Wednesday in a statement.<br><br>
          
          The allocation includes bulk purchases made by the states as well as supplies through private 
          distribution channels. This initial allocation is dynamic and will be reviewed constantly in 
          consultation with the states, to ensure all needs can be met within the available supplies, the ministry added.<br><br>
          
          Keeping in mind the sudden surge in demand in the country for Remdesivir Injection required
           for Covid-19 therapy, the manufacturing capacity of domestic Remdesivir manufacturers has been
            ramped up. The production capacity is being ramped up from current level of 38 lakh vials per
             month to 74 lakh vials per month, and 20 additional manufacturing sites have been approved. 
             Export of Remdesivir has also been prohibited on April 11, 2021 in order to shore up domestic
              supplies, as per the government release. Customs duty has also been waived for imports of Remdesivir API, injections.<br>
